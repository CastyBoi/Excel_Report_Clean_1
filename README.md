**Excel_Report_Clean_1**
A python program that takes an Excel or CSV based input file, cleans, and filters the data, then exports to a new file with multiple tabs based unique values. 

Allows user input for selecting file path, perfect for creating a sharable executable. 

This program was created with the intent of being semi-modular and dynamic. I set this up with the intention of automating other departments excel file cleaning. 

Use cases: Big reports,  unique data separated onto different tabs, a list of strings that can change, make an executable that the end user can run.

Usually if you're decent at Excel this stuff doesn't take that long, but as many of us know a lot of people really 
aren't that good at Excel. 

Have been able to shave off about 10 hours a week in data cleaning with this program.
