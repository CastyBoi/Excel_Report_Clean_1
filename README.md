# Excel_Report_Clean_1
A python program that takes an Excel or CSV based input file, cleans and filters the data, then exports to a new file with multiple tabs based unique values. 
Allows user input for seleting file path, perfect for creating a sharable executable. 
This program was created with the intent of being semi-modular and dynamic. I set this up with the intention of automating other departments excel file cleaning. The best use cases I have found thus far have been in really big reports where a lot of random rows get dropped, and separated onto different tabs. 
Usually if you're decent at Excel this stuff doesn't take that long, but as many of us know a lot of people really aren't that good at Excel.
